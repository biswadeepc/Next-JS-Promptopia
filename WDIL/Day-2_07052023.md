# Learning on Day 2.

## Error encountered while running the app for the first time

1.  While clicking on the "Sign in" button, getting the error for google OAuth as
    "Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch"

    - I inspected the console.cloud.google.com and explored the APIs & Services section
    - I clicked on the "Credentials" section and looked into the "Authorized redirect URI" section
    - I added the URL as "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/provider"
    - The actual URL should be "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google"; here the provider is google.

2.  Next I got the error while clicking on the gmail profile for OAuth authentication as
    "oauth_callback_error invalid_client (Unauthorized)"
    - I got the GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET wrong in my .env file.
    - I corrected it, and the issue got resolved.
